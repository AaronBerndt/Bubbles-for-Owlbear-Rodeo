# Stat Bubbles for D&D

Health Bars and Armor Class for your D&D adventures! Track hit points, maximum hit points, temporary hit points, armor class and hide the monsters' stats from players.

## How to use

### Basic

**This extension does math for you!** 
To add 6 to your HP type +6 and press Enter. To subtract 6 from your HP type -6 and press Enter. This works for every bubble.

**Deigned to be keyboard friendly.**

1. Click on a token and use the shortcut Shift + S (or click the extension icon in the token's context menu) to see and edit a token's trackers.
2. Press Tab to cycle through the bubbles.
3. Press the Space key to toggle the switch.
4. When you're done press Escape and the menu will close.

Works with tokens on the **Prop**, **Mount**, and **Character** layers.

The **health bar is created automatically** if a number greater than 0 is in the max health (second) bubble. Temp HP and armor class bubbles work the same way. 

### For GMs

Use the **hide switch** to hide the monster stats from your players. 

The hide switch:

* Hides the health bar from players.
* Removes the context menu icon for the players.
* Turns the health bar background black to indicate that it is hidden.

The **settings** page allows GMs (but not players) to customize the position of the token stats and add name tags.
