# Bubble Tracker

Add Roll20 style bubbles to track hit points, temporary hit points, and armor class.

## How to use

### Basic

**This extension does math for you!** 
To add 6 to you HP type +6 and press Enter. To subtract 6 to you HP type -6 and press Enter. This works for every bubble.

**Deigned to be keyboard friendly.**

1. Click on a token and use the shortcut Shift + S to see and edit a token's trackers.
2. Press Tab to cycle through the bubbles.
3. Press the Space key to toggle the switch.
4. When you're done press Escape and the menu will close.

Works with tokens on the **Prop**, **Mount**, and **Character** layers.

The **health bar is created automatically** if a number greater than 0 is in the max health (second) bubble.

### For GMs

Use the **hide switch** to hide the monster stats from your players. 

The hide switch:

* Hides the health bar from players.
* Removes the context menu icon for the players.
* Turns the health bar background black to indicate that it is hidden.
